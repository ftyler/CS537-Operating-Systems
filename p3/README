Proj3 README

We have four core modules (we didn't use the names originally given in the proj3 folder). 

parse_txt.c handles parsing the makefile into targets, dependencies, and commands. Blank 
lines and comments are ignored. It will handle invalid lines.

build_graph.c builds the graph based on targets and dependencies. It will push 'nodes' 
into a stack, popping them when they are run. 

detect_cycle.c will handle cycles in the graph, quitting with an error if one is detected.
We use an int "ancestor", setting it to 1 when we traverse to the child nodes and back to
0 when we traverse back up the graph. If it is already 0, we know there is cyclical 
dependency.

create_execute.c will create dependencies that need to be made, determining this by whether 
or not they exist or if the last write was after the target was last modified.
