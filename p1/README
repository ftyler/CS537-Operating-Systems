We separated this program into three larger modules with a supporting 
file of check_numeric.c. The larger modules are get_proc_list.c, 
options_processing.c, and parser.c. 

get_proc_list.c is used to look through the /proc directory to find a 
list of processes that belongs to the user. 

options_processing.c processes the flag values. It uses the arguments
from the user input to do so.

parser.c gets strings from lists that are in stat and statm files. It
parses them via " ". 

check_numeric.c simply ensures that an input is numeric. This is primarily
used to check the pid.
